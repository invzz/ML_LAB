# K Means

## LLoyd algorithm

1. select number k to decide the number of clusters
2. select random K points or "centroids"
3. **assign** each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K Clusters
4. calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster
5. repeat **assign**
6. if any reassignment occurs goto 4.
7. model is ready
